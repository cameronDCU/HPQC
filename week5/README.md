# Step 1: Serial Code Oscillations

The code string_wave.c was ran  and investigated. It could be seen that the parameters such as cycles, samples and output were all hardcoded into the file. The code was modified in order to choose the number of cycles and parameters, as well as the output file. 

'animate_line.py' was modified to take filename as an input, meaning it plots the input data, as well as saving the gif animation under a filename specified by the user. 

Here is an example of the wave animation generated by `animate_line.py`:

The gif created by animate_line.py was downloaded to the local computer using
 scp -J ogiugoc2@www.physics.dcu.ie ogiugoc2@cheetah.physics.dcu.ie:~/data/parameters_10_25.gif C:\Users\camer\Downloads\
